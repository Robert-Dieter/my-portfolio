        <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Robert! Thanks for stopping by. I'm a mechanical design engineer. My résumé certainly shares a lot about me (like my degrees, skills, and work experiences), but that's only half the story!
        <p>
        <p>
          This portfolio highlights the other half, proudly showcasing my work in engineering, design, and creative problem-solving. Feel free to explore some of my favorite projects, big and small. Each one exemplifies my curiosity and attention to detail.

  NOTE TO FUTURE SELF: IF YOU WISH TO ADD CARDS, DO THE FOLLOWING:
  1. Add more cards to the corresponding grid (Major Projects/Weekend Projects)
        - Copy/paste the existing block, i.e. 
            <div class="card" onclick="openModal(9)">
                <img src="assets/images/project9-thumb.jpg" alt="Weekend Project 9" />
                <h3>Weekend Project 9</h3>
            </div>
        - Increment the index in openModal(n)
  2. Update the 'projects' array in the <script> JavaScript block 
        - Copy/paste the existing block, i.e.
            {
                title: "Major Project 1",
                content: [
                { type: "text", value: "Intro to Major Project 1..." },

                ]
            },
        - Make sure the index in openModal(n) matches the position of the project in the array
