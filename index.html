        <p>
          Hi, I'm Robert! Thanks for stopping by. I'm a mechanical design engineer. My résumé certainly shares a lot about me (like my degrees, skills, and work experiences), but that's only half the story!
        <p>
        <p>
          This portfolio highlights the other half, proudly showcasing my work in engineering, design, and creative problem-solving. Feel free to explore some of my favorite projects, big and small. Each one exemplifies my curiosity and attention to detail.

The force/displacement curve displays brittle behavior, which is what it was idealized to be. Since the concrete plate, in reality, is a quasi-brittle material, an ultimate failure load lower than the experimental value (1500 lbs) was expected. Finally, the crack pattern on the deformed shape mirrors the experimentally observed failure behavior as well." },
